              This website is operated by WarmBox to provide information about our self-heating food
              packaging products and to receive enquiries from prospective customers and business
              partners. Product specifications shown here are subject to change as the product is
              finalised.

              Where specifications are marked "available on request" or similar, this reflects that
              final product details have not yet been published. Nothing on this website constitutes

              Submitting an enquiry or quote request through this website does not create a contract
